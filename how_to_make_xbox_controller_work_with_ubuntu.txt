Install xpadneo driver

For good measure disable the wifi when trying to connect the Xbox via Bluetooth
Also, forget the controller before trying to connect again

Then follow the steps at this reddit post: https://reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/smxqm2/how_to_use_xpadneo_with_an_xbox_series_controller

Copy-pasted the post here:
1.Enabling uhid

First we need to enable the UserspaceHID if we don't do that the Controller won't connect properly and begins to connect and disconnect in a cycle and the Xbox Button will keep flashing

All you need to do is edit/create /etc/bluetooth/input.conf with your editor of choice (I prefer nano) In there paste this:

# Enable HID protocol handling in userspace input profile
# Defaults to false (HIDP handled in HIDP kernel module)
UserspaceHID=true

2. Edit the main bluetooth config

We need to set some settings in the main bluetooth config file so xpadneo will work as intended and we also need to address the input lag Problem all you need to do is editing /etc/bluetooth/main.conf pasting in this:

[General]
Privacy = device
JustWorksRepairing = always
Class = 0x000100
FastConnectable = true

[LE]
MinConnectionInterval=7
MaxConnectionInterval=9
ConnectionLatency=0

3. Installing xpadneo

Install bluez bluez-utils and dkms beforehand

git clone https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo.git
cd xpadneo
sudo ./install.sh

Afterwards Reboot your system

4. Pairing the Series Controller with the PC

sudo bluetoothctl
scan on    
(stop the scan as soon as you see that "Xbox Wireless Controller" is popping up)
scan off (copy the Mac Address of the controller)
pair <MAC Address you've copied>
trust <MAC Address you've copied>
connect <MAC Address you've copied>
